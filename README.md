# MMCEssentials
I wanted to develop a plugin that allowed our users to decide when to restart the server. Mostly as a tool for when staff are not online.

Feedback is very much appreciated! If you found an issue, please report it!
Please use the "issues" page on Github!

All Modded Miencraft modpacks run this plugin.

## Download
A download for this will be provided as soon as possible.

###Installation
Some features of this plugin require ProtocalLib. It is not essential to run though.

Just drop, restart and go. No configuration is needed.
You can look at the config.yml and change what you want however.

###Major features
- Allow users to vote to restart the server.
- Set an auto-restart after a set amount of hours.
- Schedule a restart in seconds, minutes or hours.
- Votes / 5 minute restart countdown is shown in a sidebar scoreboard.

####Side features
- Disable players ability to see your plugins list by providing a fake list.
- Provide per command permissions for /COFH and /Tickdynamic.
